      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello reader! My name is Shanice, I'm 30 years old from Nottingham, England. I am learning coding and how to create websites and I wanted to create a blog about my first time in Jamaica.</p>
      <p>Firstly, I want to share why going to Jamaica for the first time is such a huge deal for me! I am of mixed heritage - my dad's parents are from Clarendon in Jamaica and my mum's family are a mixture of UK and Ireland. My grandma and grandpa met in Jamaica before they came over to England in 1956 where they both moved to Nottingham which is where eventually my whole family grew up. They both often spoke about Jamaica, where they grew up, what it was like and what they missed about it. However, as a young kid, I didn't really understand it, nor was I even interested...but as I grew up and learned more about my heritage, I became more curious and wanted to learn more. My grandma unfortunately passed away when I was just 7 years old and my grandpa passed away in 2021. So as I became more curious, I asked my grandpa more questions about where he grew up and what Jamaica was like. I'm not going to share what our conversatons were as that is something very sacred to me, but what I will say is it helped me understand and love the culture more and I was DESEPRATE to go to Jamaica to experience it myself.</p>

      <p>Now, you are probably wondering why on earth it took me 30 long whole years to go to Jamaica. Well firstly, it's an expensive trip which my parents were unable to afford for a long time. But also, we had heard many negative things about Jamaica from other people which probably put my family off for a long time. I don't know if Jamaica was going through a difficult political period at that time or whether people were being over dramatic, but unfortunately we listened to those people and did not go sooner. I'm here to tell you that what I have experienced in Jamaica is wayyyyyyyy different to what I have been told and I am almost angry at the people who told me otherwise! Lesson learned - you don't always have to listen to people!! On the other hand, I do believe timing is everything and maybe this was the right time for me and my family to go. God's timing.</p>
      <p>My family and I have celebrated some pretty big milestones in 2023:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My mum turned 60</li>
        <li>I turned 30</li>
        <li>My brother turned 21</li>
        <li>And my parents are celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So maybe, 2023 was always meant to be the year for us to go to Jamaica and celebrate these big milestones. It is also to celebrate the memory of my grandparents, getting a taste of what life was like for them before they travelled to the UK.</p>
      <p>This blog is nothing serious, is more to practice the skills I've learned so far in coding whilst also creating something that interests me. Happy reading!</p>
